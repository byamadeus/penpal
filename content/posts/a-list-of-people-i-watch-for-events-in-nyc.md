My brother recently asked how i find things to do. Here's a running list of how I keep my ears open and eyes open to the people and communities I want to involve myself in.

*I check these places for what they're hosting. They have space that is used for workshops, events, classes, talks.*

**Other ways to find people doing things**

*I have also used the following methods to make friends and spark that feeling of meeting new people while here.*

go dancing (style you've never danced)

ask someone what book they're reading

go to the same cafe 3 times, at the same time

go rock climbing and do something too hard for you

ask someone what they like doing (not what they do)

walk until you get bored, then walk into a store
