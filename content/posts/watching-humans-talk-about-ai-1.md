And I will add, it's fascinating to keep talking about it at work. Work now must require the use of AI in some shape and form.

The first fascinating element is that tech is a cultural bubble (technical field, infrastructure, attracts a certain type of person), but yet there is diversity of thought and background. These talks and events have shown me people who are genuinely calling for unions against corporations, or a more “get your bag and get out” mindset; people ask for democratic approaches to technology, while using the proprietary products day-to-day. What an interesting place this is.

What is the point of having a “perfect” piece of art? What’s even the point of learning in school? What’s the point of an educator, a teacher? What happens to a child who learned from an AI? Maybe we actually want kids to share homework answers? What is a community? Why is it so hard to have a meeting in person? Do we really even need work? … and so on…

For a human, it seems like it’s something unexpected, something that feels “new” typically hits this category. If we had infinite knowledge, capabilities, and potential, what would creativity be? The comments between a line of code that communicates a little better? The word you use to describe the way you think?*
