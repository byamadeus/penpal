# Welcome to Your Email-Powered Blog!

This is an example email that demonstrates how to create blog posts by sending emails.

## How It Works

Simply send an email with your secret token in the subject line, and the system automatically:

*   Converts your email to markdown
*   Saves it to your repository
*   Triggers a rebuild of your blog
*   Makes your post live within minutes!

## Features

*   **Rich Text Support** - Write in HTML or plain text
*   **Image Attachments** - Add images to your posts
*   **Thread Series** - Reply to emails to create linked series
*   **Markdown Export** - Posts are portable across platforms

> The best blogging workflow is the one you already use - email!

### Next Steps

1.  Replace `your-secret-token` with your actual token
2.  Process this email locally: `cat example-email.eml | npm run process-email`
3.  Check `content/posts/` for the generated markdown
4.  Start writing your own posts!

Happy blogging!
